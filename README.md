# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Model
This machine learning project is designed to help banks and financial institutions predict whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan or not. Making accurate loan eligibility predictions is crucial for banks to manage risks and ensure responsible lending.

In this project, we have developed a machine learning model from scratch  that takes various applicant features as input and predicts whether an applicant should be granted a loan or not. The model is based on historical loan data and uses a combination of classification algorithms to make these predictions.
